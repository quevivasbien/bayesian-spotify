This repository contains code and data for a project using Bayesian statistical tools to determine what features of songs are associated with popularity on Spotify as well as what features I prefer personally.

See [this writeup](https://github.com/quevivasbien/bayesian-spotify/bayesian_spotify.pdf) for an explanation of what's going on here.
